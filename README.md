These are the files for the ACLAS 80mm printer PP7X and PP7M3 printers. This comes from the manufacturer however their link is for a chinese site that did not support https. Therefore I took the files and scanned them with virustotal, ensured that they were safe enough and have uploaded them here. This printer is great for it's price and if you want to buy one you can find it here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0834Y4F7J (non affliate link).
